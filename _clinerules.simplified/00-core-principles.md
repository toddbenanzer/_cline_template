# Core Principles

## Primary Goal: Learn Python Through Building

Every task, line of code, and interaction should optimize for learning and understanding.

- **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Code must be simple, readable, and understandable for skill level 4/10
- **Practical Application**: Build real tools to solve real problems - most effective for learning
- **Safety and Simplicity**: For personal projects, prioritize simple, safe patterns over enterprise complexity

## Progressive Complexity Pattern

Develop every feature and skill incrementally:

1. **Make it Work**: Start with simplest possible implementation for core functionality
2. **Make it Safe**: Add robust error handling, input validation, and logging
3. **Make it Flexible**: Introduce configuration options, parameters, and modularity

This pattern applies to individual functions, entire scripts, and project-wide features.

## Complete Code Mandate

**MUST ALWAYS** provide complete, runnable code:

- **No Omissions**: Never use "..." or "rest of code remains the same"
- **All Imports Included**: Every script must include all necessary imports
- **Helper Functions Provided**: Include all dependencies in their entirety
- **Full Context**: When modifying functions, provide the entire new function

This rule is non-negotiable and critical for maintaining clear learning path.

## Explain the "Why," Not Just the "What"

Comments and explanations should focus on reasoning behind the code:

- **Good**: `# Use dictionary for fast lookups (O(1) complexity)`
- **Bad**: `# This is a dictionary`

Every new concept, pattern, or library should include simple explanation of what it is, why it's used, and what learning goal it achieves.
