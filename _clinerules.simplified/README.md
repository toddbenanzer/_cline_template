# Simplified Cline Rules

## Purpose

These simplified rules are designed to reduce cognitive load and "vibe coding costs" by focusing on core principles and high-level guidelines. They distill the essential elements from the more detailed rules while maintaining the learning-focused development approach.

## Core Philosophy

- **Learn Python Through Building**: Every task should optimize for learning and understanding
- **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Code must be simple, readable, and appropriate for skill level 4/10
- **Progressive Complexity**: Build incrementally - Make it Work → Make it Safe → Make it Flexible
- **Complete Code Always**: Never use "..." or omit parts - provide full, runnable implementations

## File Structure

- `00-core-principles.md` - Fundamental development philosophy and mandates
- `01-interaction-protocol.md` - Communication standards and confidence scoring
- `02-technical-standards.md` - Environment, coding, and quality standards
- `03-workflow-and-memory.md` - Memory bank system and project workflows
- `04-prompting-guidelines.md` - Effective prompting patterns and principles

## Usage

These rules provide the essential framework for productive development sessions. Detailed examples, templates, and extensive code snippets can be generated on demand when needed for specific tasks.
