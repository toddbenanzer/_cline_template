## What I'm Building
[Simple description: e.g., "A Python tool to organize my photo collection by date and location"]

## Why I'm Building It
[Personal motivation: e.g., "My photos are scattered across folders and I can't find anything when I need it"]

## Main Goals
- [Goal 1: e.g., "Automatically sort photos into year/month folders"]
- [Goal 2: e.g., "Handle duplicate photos safely"]
- [Goal 3: e.g., "Work reliably in my Docker development environment"]

## Success Looks Like
[How will I know it's working: e.g., "I can find photos from specific events quickly and easily"]

## Learning Goals
- [What I want to learn: e.g., "Working with file metadata and image processing"]
- [Python concepts to practice: e.g., "pathlib, datetime, and basic error handling"]
- [Docker skills: e.g., "Volume mounting and environment variables"]

## Development Environment
- **Setup**: VS Code + Docker + WSL2
- **Skill Level**: 4/10 Python developer
- **Project Type**: Personal use module/application
- **Preferences**: Readability over elegance, minimal features first

## Constraints
- **Technical**: Must work in Docker container with volume mounts
- **Personal**: Keep it simple - I'm still learning Python
- **Time**: Want basic version working in a few coding sessions
- **Complexity**: Minimal error handling, focus on core functionality

# Development Environment Notes

## Docker Setup

### Current Configuration
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml highlights
services:
  app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - app_data:/app/app_i_am_developing/data
    environment:
      - PYTHONPATH=/app
      - DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true
```

### Container Details
- **Base image**: [python:3.11-slim or whatever you're using]
- **Working directory**: /app
- **Python path**: /app (so imports work)
- **Port mappings**: [8000:8000 for web, 8888:8888 for jupyter, etc.]

### Volume Mounts
- **Source code**: . -> /app (full project mount)
- **Data persistence**: app_data -> /app/app_i_am_developing/data
- **Issues**: [Any problems with file permissions or sync]

## VS Code Integration

5. Open terminal in container
```

### Debugging Setup

SRC_PATH = BASE_PATH / 'src'
DATA_PATH = BASE_PATH / 'data'
CONFIG_PATH = BASE_PATH / 'config'
EXAMPLES_PATH = BASE_PATH / 'examples'
```

### Path Issues I've Solved

## Environment Variables

### Development Environment
```bash
# .env file contents
DEBUG=true
DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true
DATA_PATH=/app/app_i_am_developing/data
PYTHONPATH=/app
```

### How I Use Them
```python
import os
DEBUG = os.getenv('DEBUG', 'false').lower() == 'true'
DATA_PATH = Path(os.getenv('DATA_PATH', './data'))
```

## Docker Commands I Use

### Daily Commands
```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs app

# Execute commands in container
docker-compose exec app python -m app_i_am_developing.src.main

# Run tests
docker-compose exec app python -m app_i_am_developing.tests.test_basic

# Stop everything
docker-compose down
```

### Troubleshooting Commands
```bash
# Rebuild container (when Dockerfile changes)
docker-compose build

# Clean restart
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d

# Interactive shell in container
docker-compose exec app bash

# Check container status
