## Code Snippets to Remember

### Pattern: Safe File Reading

```python
def read_file_safely(filepath):
    """Pattern I use often"""
    path = Path(filepath)
    if not path.exists():
        return None
    try:
        return path.read_text()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None
```

### Pattern: API Call with Retry

```python
def api_call_with_retry(url, max_retries=3):
    """Reliable API calling pattern"""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
            response.raise_for_status()
            return response.json()
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)

   **Solution**: [How to fix]

   ```bash
   # Commands that fixed it
   ```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Import Error in Container

**Symptom**: `ModuleNotFoundError` even after pip install
**Cause**: Python path not set correctly
**Solution**:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/app:$PYTHONPATH
# Or add to Dockerfile
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app:$PYTHONPATH
```

### Issue: File Not Found in Container

**Symptom**: Works locally but not in container
**Cause**: Path differences between local and container
**Solution**: Always use absolute paths from `/app/app_i_am_developing/`

### Issue: [Common Issue]

**Symptom**: [What you see]
**Cause**: [Why it happens]
**Solution**: [How to fix]

## Debugging Techniques That Work

### For Web Scraping Issues

```python
# Save HTML for offline debugging
def debug_scraping():
    response = requests.get(url)
    with open('/app/app_i_am_developing/debug/page.html', 'w') as f:
        f.write(response.text)
    # Now can test parsing without hitting site
```

### For Data Processing Issues

```python
# Check data at each step
def debug_pipeline(df):
    print(f"Step 1 - Shape: {df.shape}")
    print(f"Step 1 - Columns: {df.columns.tolist()}")
    print(f"Step 1 - Sample:\n{df.head()}")
    # Continue for each transformation
```

### For API Issues

```python
# Log full request/response
def debug_api_call(url, params):
    print(f"URL: {url}")
    print(f"Params: {params}")
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    print(f"Status: {response.status_code}")
    print(f"Headers: {dict(response.headers)}")
    print(f"Response: {response.text[:500]}")
```
