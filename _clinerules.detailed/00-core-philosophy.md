# Core Philosophy: Learning-Focused Development

## 1. Primary Goal: Learn Python Through Building

The fundamental goal of this development process is to learn Python by building useful, personal tools. Every task, every line of code, and every interaction should be optimized for learning and understanding.

- **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Code must be simple, readable, and easy to understand for a developer with a 4/10 skill level. Avoid complex one-liners or obscure idioms.
- **Practical Application**: We build real tools to solve real problems, as this is the most effective way to learn and retain knowledge.
- **Safety and Simplicity**: For personal projects, we prioritize simple, safe patterns over enterprise-grade complexity.

## 2. The Progressive Complexity Pattern

Every feature and skill should be developed incrementally. This breaks down complex problems into manageable, educational steps.

**The Three Stages:**
1.  **Make it Work**: Start with the simplest possible implementation to achieve the core functionality.
2.  **Make it Safe**: Add robust error handling, input validation, and logging.
3.  **Make it Flexible**: Introduce configuration options, parameters, and modularity to make the code reusable and adaptable.

This pattern applies to individual functions, entire scripts, and project-wide features.

## 3. The "Complete Code" Mandate

To ensure clarity and prevent confusion, you **MUST ALWAYS** provide complete, runnable code.

**This means:**
- **No Omissions**: Never use "..." or comments like "rest of the code remains the same."
- **All Imports Included**: Every script or snippet must include all necessary `import` statements at the top.
- **Helper Functions Provided**: If a function relies on helpers, they must also be included in their entirety.
- **Full Context**: When modifying a function, provide the entire new function, not just the changed lines.

This rule is non-negotiable and critical for maintaining a clear learning path.

## 4. Explain the "Why," Not Just the "What"

Comments and explanations should focus on the reasoning behind the code.

- **Good Comment**: `// Use a dictionary for fast lookups (O(1) complexity)`
- **Bad Comment**: `// This is a dictionary`

Every new concept, pattern, or library should be accompanied by a simple explanation of what it is, why it's being used, and what learning goal it achieves.
